          Our next steps involve expanding the catalogâ€™s reach and
          functionality. With over 1,500 entries already compiled, our aim is to
          include datasets from every province and territory in Canada. This
          growth will be supported by partnerships with cultural organizations,
          academic institutions, and policymakers. To enhance usability, we plan
          to integrate rating and feedback mechanisms, allowing users to
          evaluate datasets and provide input on their relevance and quality.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 font-light">
          User research will play a critical role in validating our metadata
          framework and interface design, with input from initiatives such the
          Digital Data Service project in collaboration with Galeries Ontario
          Galleries, OCADU Policy Hub, CDCE, and Heritage Canada.

          The online platform will serve as the main channel for users to
          explore and interact with the Canadian Cultural Data Catalogue. Users
          can browse datasets using filters or advanced searches, view results
          in list or card formats that highlight key metadata. The primary
          features are:

            Users can explore the catalogue via visualized metadata to
            understand relationships between datasets, identify data gaps, and
            track dataset usage, providing an overview of the Canadian cultural
            data ecosystem.

            Users can submit datasets they own or host. The platform guides them
            in populating metadata for new entries and the input will be curated
            by our team.
